## Question: Does my company need Double-entry or Single-enty bookkeeping?
Based on https://www.vero.fi/en/businesses-and-corporations/business-operations/setting-up-a-business/accounting-financial-year-tax-period/ my company is not toiminimi => needs ~~single-entry bookkeeping~~ double-entry bookkeeping

## Question: what attachments are needed when reporting tax
Answer: https://www.vero.fi/yritykset-ja-yhteisot/verot-ja-maksut/osakeyhtio-ja-osuuskunta/veroilmoitus/ilmoittamisen-ohje/#Tilinpaatostiedot

=> need tilinpäätös:
* income statement
* balance sheet

## [Cash Accounting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t9PFHlLLVI) (probably irrelevant to my company)
* Transactions are only recorded when cash changes hands
* revenue is recognized once cash is received
* expenses are recorded once cash is paid out

## revisit [tutorial about pyproject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6tALyc4C10&t=1375s&pp=0gcJCTAAlc8ueATH)
### [*src-layout*](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/package_discovery.html#src-layout)
### [*flat-layout*](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/package_discovery.html#flat-layout)

> This layout is very practical for using the [*REPL*](https://peps.python.org/pep-0762/)

Moreover, Gemini suggested when to use flat-layout:

* Simple Projects: For small scripts, personal tools, or tutorials where you want the lowest barrier to entry.

* Beginners: It’s intuitive because what you see is what you get.

* Non-distributed code: If you aren’t planning to upload the code to PyPI and just want to run it locally.

**So as to my current SIMPLE project, *flat-layout* suffices**
